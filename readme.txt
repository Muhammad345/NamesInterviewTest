Talent Clouds Developer Task
In this solution you will find three projects.
1.	A data access layer Project
2.	MVC Web Project
3.	Unit Test Project
Task 1 - Code
•	Using the two sources provided in the DAL project and the Source3.txt file located in the sources folder, create a function that counts how many times the first character of the forename appears in all lists. 
•	Put all invalid entries into a separate list and store as a txt file, these are names that do not fit the pattern “Surname, Forename”
•	Names can be duplicated and in both lists. Ensure that names are not counted twice.        
•	Output the results to the browser how you like.
Task 2 - UI
